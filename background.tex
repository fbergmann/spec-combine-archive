\subsection{Past work on this problem or similar topics}
The COMBINE Archive has been formed out of the SED-ML Archive, that was 
first introduced in the SED-ML mailing list in 2009, and briefly described
in SED-ML Level~1 Version~1 \cite{sedmll1v1}. The SED-ML Archive, addressed the need of 
prividing a way to include all relevant models used in a SED-ML simulation
experiment along with the experiment specification. The SED-ML archive is 
basically the convention to provide inside a ZIP file (with extension .sedx)
a SED-ML document with the same base name as the extension. That was sufficient 
for SED-ML. 

The COMBINE Archive extends this approach by a metafile, that allows to include 
provenance information with the archive, and a specification of the content types
of files included in the COMBINE Archive (the manifest). 

This approach also makes it easy to extend approaches using a distributed version 
control system (like PMR2) to export COMBINE archives, by generating a manifest file
during export. 

This specification has been created out of the many discussions that took place
on the combine-discuss mailing list. The primary threads are located here:

\end{itemize}

The discussion continued at the last Hackathons, HARMONY 2012 where
for the first time a larger audience discussed a \href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/10tI1NwehBVDTxE5Q11APx7bZVoeNVJdFMiBdPywZKZM/edit}{preliminary proposal} put together by Richard Adams, Frank T. Bergmann and Nicolas Le Nov\`{e}re.  
Further discussions were held at \href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ji2mOiWzXXl9ON6sU6Svd3E_IufowUCz24hklqci0iM/edit}{HARMONY\_2013}.
