\section{Best practices}
\label{best-practices}

In this section, we recommend a number of practices for using and 
interpreting various constructs in the COMBINE Archive. These 
recommendations are non-normative, but we advocate them strongly; 
ignoring them will not render a model invalid, but may reduce 
inter-operability between software and models.
