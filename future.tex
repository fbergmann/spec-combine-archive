\section{Future development}
\label{future}
In this section we highlight some open issues not addressed in this 
version of the COMBINE archive specification. 


\subsection{Linking to external documents}
It was often discussed to also allow the \token{location} elements of a 
\Content element point to an external document. However, in this first 
version we restrict them to local files, so as to make it easier to 
adopt. 

\subsection{Cross References between entries}
At HARMONY we spend some time discussing whether cross references 
between the individual entries in the archive ought to be in this first 
version of the specification. However, it was decided to leave the cross 
referencing to the individual standards for now, rather to impose them 
ad-hoc. 

\subsection{Alternative versions of the archive metadata}
It was suggested to allow different versions of the archive metadata 
format. The manifest already provides a way for referencing alternate 
versions, all that would need to be changed, would be the format 
identifier to point to a different specification rather than: 


\url{http://identifiers.org/combine.specifications/omex-metadata}

However, as of the time of this writing no such format was proposed.
