\section{Proposed syntax and semantics}
\label{syntax}

In this section, we define the syntax and semantics of the COMBINE 
Archive. We expound on the various data types and constructs defined, 
then in \sect{examples}, we provide complete examples of using the 
constructs in an example archive. 



\subsection{The archive format}
The COMBINE archive is a "zip" file \cite{zipFile}. Zip is a file format 
used for data compression and archiving. A zip file contains one or more 
files that have been compressed, to reduce file size, or stored as is. 
The technical specification of the ZIP format is available from the 
PKWARE website \cite{zipSpec}. 


\subsection{COMBINE archive extensions}
\label{combine-archive-extensions}
The extension for the COMBINE archive is \token{.omex}, for "{O}pen 
{M}odeling {EX}change format". If a COMBINE archive with that extension 
is encountered, an application should present the user with the 
\textit{active document} (see also \ref{active_document}). 


Additional extensions are being used, so that applications can quickly 
open a specific file from the COMBINE archive. This provides users with 
a consistent behavior in that each time such a file is opened, the 
corresponding same main file opens. The extensions in use are: 


\begin{itemize}
	\item {\token{.sedx} - SED-ML archive}
	\item {\token{.sbex} - SBML archive}
	\item {\token{.cmex} - CellML archive}
	\item {\token{.neux} - NeuroML archive}
	\item {\token{.phex} - PharmML archive}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Content of the archive}

The archive contains: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item {
	
     a manifest file, called \token{manifest.xml}, always located at the 
     root of the archive, that describes the location and the type of each 
     data file contained in the archive (including itself). 
     
     The location of those files is defined by a relative URI. In the current 
     version of the COMBINE archive, all the files described must be included 
     in the archive itself. It is envisioned that in the future the manifest 
     could list files located elsewhere, using valid and resolvable http 
     URIs. 

	}
	\item {
     a metadata file, called \token{metadata.*} (where \token{*} means the 
     suitable file extension) containing clerical information about the 
     various files contained in the archive, and the archive itself. 
	}
	\item {all the remaining files necessary to the model and simulation project. }

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Namespace URI and other declarations necessary}
\label{xml-namespace}

The COMBINE archive defines a namespace URI that allows to uniquely 
identify the manifest. The following is the namespace URI for this 
version of the COMBINE archive manifest: 


\begin{center}
\uri{http://identifiers.org/combine.specifications/omex-manifest}
\end{center}

\subsection{Primitive data types}
\label{primtypes}

The COMBINE archive uses the XML Schema 1.0 data types~\citep{biron:2000}.
More specifically we make use of \primtype{integer}, \primtype{double},
and \primtype{string}.


\newpage
\subsection{The \token{manifest.xml} file and the \class{OmexManifest} class}
\label{manifest-class}

At the root of the COMBINE archive stands one file, with the prescribed name \token{manifest.xml}. This file cotnains an instantiation of the \OmexManifest class. 

It contains a number of \Content children, one of which represents the manifest itself. 

Note that a valid manifest needs to have at least one entry, that of the manifest itself, but may 
contain as many entries as needed.

  \caption{A UML representation of the Manifest. Each manifest contains a number
	of Content elements.}
  \label{fig:combine_uml}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The \class{Content} class}
\label{content-class}
The \Content class represents an entry in the \OmexManifest and by 
extension a file in the \textit{COMBINE archive}. It consists of two 
required attributes: \token{location} and \token{format} and the 
optional attribute \token{master} 

\paragraph{The \token{location} attribute}
The \token{location} attribute is a required attribute of type 
\token{string}. It represents a relative location to an entry within the 
archive. The root of the archive is represented by a dot \token{'.'}. 

\paragraph{The \token{format} attribute}
The \token{format} is a required attribute of type \token{string}. It 
indicates the file type of the \Content element. The values of the 
\token{format} attribute fall in two categories. Either the format 
denotes one of the COMBINE standards, in which case the \token{format} 
will begin with its \token{identifiers.org} url. Otherwise the 
\token{format} will represent a MIME type. 

Using \token{identifiers.org} allows to unambiguously define the COMBINE standard, and even its level and version. For example, the identifier: \token{http://identifiers.org/combine.specifications/sbml} would denote the \Content 
element as being encoded in the SBML format. That is usually sufficient, as tools supporting one level of SBML usually
support others as well. However, if the software exporting the COMBINE archive wanted to be more precise, it could specify that it is an SBML Level 2 document with 

\begin{center}
\token{http://identifiers.org/combine.specifications/sbml.level-2}
\end{center}

or even declare its Version with 

\begin{center}
\token{http://identifiers.org/combine.specifications/sbml.level-2.version-3}.
\end{center}


\paragraph{The \token{master} attribute}
\label{active_document}
The \token{master} is an optional attribute of type \token{boolean}. It 
represents a hint, that a certain file is to be used first when 
processing the content of an archive. Are top model description in a 
composed model, calling the various submodels; simulation description, 
calling the different model descriptions and data sources used in the 
experiment. At most one content element per archive may have its master 
attribute set to \token{true}. For example in the snippet below, it is the 
SED-ML element with \token{location="./simulation.xml"} that a software 
program should first present to their users.

\begin{example}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<omexManifest xmlns="http://identifiers.org/combine.specifications/omex-manifest">
    <content location="./manifest.xml" 
		         format="http://identifiers.org/combine.specifications/omex-manifest"/>
    <content location="./model/model.xml" 
		         format="http://identifiers.org/combine.specifications/sbml"/>
    <content location="./simulation.xml" master="true"
		         format="http://identifiers.org/combine.specifications/sedml"/>
    <content location="./article.pdf" 
		         format="application/pdf"/>
    <content location="./metadata.rdf" 
		         format="http://identifiers.org/combine.specifications/omex-metadata"/>
</omexManifest>
\end{example}

To simplify the identification of the active document the file extensions 
(see also \ref{combine-archive-extensions}) can also be used. For the example above, 
where a SED-ML document is being marked as the master document, the 
recommended extension would be \token{.sedx}. 

\subsection{Advised format for the archive metadata}

One can include any type of file in a COMBINE archive, and therefore any 
type of metadata format. However, in the interest of interoperability, 
and to ease the development of software support for metadata, a 
recommended format is provided as part of the specification of the 
archive. 

The recommended format is based on several standards developed by other 
organisations: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item  {
	
     The \href{http://www.w3.org/RDF/ }{ Resource Description Format} of the 
     W3C, in particular its \token{RDF}, \token{Description}, \token{Bag} and 
     \token{li} elements. 

	}
	\item  {

	vCard 4 (\cite{rfc6350}), a file format standard for electronic business 
    cards. (More information on how to use vCard in RDF can be found 
    on the W3C website\footnote[1]{\url{http://www.w3.org/TR/vcard-rdf/ }}. 

	}
	\item {
	
	Metadata 
	Terms\footnote[2]{\url{http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/}} of 
	the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative, in particular the terms: 

	\begin{itemize}
		\item \token{description}, 
		\item \token{creator}, 
		\item \token{created}, 
		\item \token{modified}
		\item \token{W3CDTF}.
	\end{itemize}
		
	More information on the use of Dublin Core in RDF can be found 
	on the Dublin Core website{\footnote[3]{\url{http://dublincore.org/documents/dc-rdf/}}} } 
	
	The definition of the date format used within \token{dcterms:created} and 
	\token{dcterms:modified} elements see the note on the W3C Website 
	{\footnote[4]{\url{http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime}}}.

\end{itemize}
\pagebreak
Users of the COMBINE standards may already be familiar with this 
approach, as it is also taken by the Systems Biology Markup Language. 
Note however that the format here slightly differs from the controlled 
annotations of SBML. The differences have been made to address inconsistencies 
in the SBML vCard specification and to follow W3C recommendations. The changes 
are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item  "Family" becomes "family-name" 
	\item  "Given" becomes "given-name" 
	\item  "EMAIL" becomes "email" 
	\item  "Orgname" becomes "organization-name" 
\end{itemize}

A \textit{COMBINE archive} can include multiple metadata elements. To 
identify that a particular \Content element is being annotated, the 
\token{rdf:about} attribute should use the same value that is also used 
in \token{location} of the \Content element. 


\begin{example}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" 
         xmlns:dcterms="http://purl.org/dc/terms/" 
				 xmlns:vCard="http://www.w3.org/2006/vcard/ns#">
   <rdf:Description rdf:about="./simulation.xml">
   ...
	 </rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>
\end{example}

The example above signifies that a content element with 
\token{location="./simulation.xml"} is described. A complete example of 
the metadata related to a simulation description contained in a COMBINE 
archive is described in \ref{examples}.
